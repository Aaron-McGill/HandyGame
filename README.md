# HandyGame

This branch is adding a simple UI built with [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) and [pygame_gui](https://pygame-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

The logic for the game is in the game_ui.py file. The game.py file is not currently being used; it's just there for reference as the UI is still a work
in progress.
