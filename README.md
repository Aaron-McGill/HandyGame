# HandyGame

This is the client for the server defined here: https://github.com/Aaron-McGill/HandyGameServer

To run this locally, you'd open three terminals.

In the first terminal, you'd clone the HandyGameServer project above and run it using this command:

`
py app.py
`

In the other two terminals, you'd open a copy of this project and run this command:

`
py main.py
`

With the server running, you should be able to play a game of tic-tac-toe from the two windows that opened. Currently, only tic-tac-toe has online support. Connect Four is still designed to be played from a single window.
